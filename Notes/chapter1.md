 # chapter 1

 ## what is algorithm?
 - any well-defined computational procedure 
 - tool for solving a well-specified computational problem
 - a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

 ## what is data structures?
 -  a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

 NP-complete problems: `no one knows if NP-complete is an efficient or not efficient algorithms and if it efficient for one, it can be efficient for all . `


 insertion sort: ` takes time  n^2 `
 merge sort: ` takes time  n lg n `

 **running time of merge sort is much smaller than insertion sort**
